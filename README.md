## **Introduction**
This project is Task 1 of my Python Developer internship at LetsGrowMore. The goal is to create a tool which creates GIF images from videos, using Python. The approach taken for this task is creating a GUI application which fulfills all of the desired functions (e.g. adding files, setting parameters and saving files).

## **Details**

The majority of people use these to communicate with others on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. We will build a GIF Creator that creates GIFs from images here. In this project, you will be using the `moviepy` Python module for development purposes.
